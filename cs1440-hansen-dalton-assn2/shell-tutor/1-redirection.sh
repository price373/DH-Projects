	Shell Redirection Lesson: How to control where the output of a shell
	command goes.

	In this lesson you will learn

	* How to redirect shell command output to a file
	* How to append shell command output a file
	* The $(_STDOUT) file descriptor
	* The $(_STDERR) file descriptor
	* Control printing to $(_STDOUT) or $(_STDERR) in python
	* How to remove unneeded command output

	Commands used in this lesson
	============================
	* $(cmd '>')
	    * Redirect only standard output to a file
	* $(cmd '>>')
	    * Redirect only standard output to a file, appending to existing file
	* $(cmd '2>')
	    * Redirect only standard error to a file
	* $(cmd '&>')
	    * Redirect standard output and standard error to a file
	* $(path /dev/null)
	    * A special file that acts as a $(bld 'black hole'), swallowing up all
	        information given to it

	Let's get started!

	I'm sure you've used the $(cmd cat) command plenty of times by now. Most
	likely to have the contents of a file print out to the terminal. Are
	you aware of what the $(cmd cat) command stands for and it's original
	purpose?

	The $(cmd cat) command stands for $(bld concatenate); the process of linking
	things together. The $(cmd cat) command was created to allow someone to
	concatenate multiple text files together into one! This is done by
	giving the $(cmd cat) command multiple arguments in the order we want the
	files to be concatenated together.

	Try that now. Let's concatenate $(path first.md) and $(path second.md) together.

	What if we want to concatenate those files together *and* save the
	output to a file? Well, we could always just highlight all of that
	output, copy it, open a text editor, and paste it there. That's really
	tedious though. There must be a better way...

	Luckily for us, our system shell has a feature that will help! Shell
	output redirection is the solution to our problems. We have the ability
	to place the output from one command into a specified file by adding
	just a few more characters to our initial command.

	To redirect the command output to a file, we add $(cmd '> FILENAME') to the
	end of our shell command. $(cmd '>') is the key operator that tells our shell
	we want to redirect the output, and $(path FILENAME) is the file we want to
	place the output into.

	Be careful when doing this, as the file $(path FILENAME) will be removed and
	replaced by the command output in the process.

	So far you have only redirected a program's $(_STDOUT ordinary output) to a
	file.  But a program can generate more types of output than what
	counts as $(_STDOUT ordinary).

	Your operating system differentiates between $(_STDOUT ordinary) and $(_STDERR error) output.

	$(_STDOUT Ordinary output) is also called $(_STDOUT standard output), or $(_STDOUT) for short.

	The second kind of output, used for error messages, is called $(_STDERR standard)
	$(_STDERR error), abbreviated as $(_STDERR).

	Programmers can choose which of these destinations that $(_code "print()") messages
	are sent.  By default, messages sent to $(_STDOUT) and $(_STDERR) both end
	up on the screen.  However, a user who knows how redirection works can
	control whether messages appear on the screen, go to files, or are
	ignored altogether.

	Redirection of $(_STDERR) uses a slightly different redirection operator.

	$(_STDERR) is redirected with a slightly different operator.  $(cmd '2>') redirects

	Why is it $(cmd '2>')?  Because $(_STDERR) is the $(bld second) file that was automatically
