# CS 1440 Assignment 1: DuckieDecrypter - Test data

This directory contains files that may be consumed by your program to assist you in its development.

*   DuckieCrypt files for your program to decrypt.  Compare your program's output to the provided solutions
    *   [msg0.txt](./msg0.txt) (solution [sln/msg0.txt](./sln/msg0.txt)) 
    *   [msg1.txt](./msg1.txt) (solution [sln/msg1.txt](./sln/msg1.txt)) 
    *   [msg2](./msg2)         (solution [sln/msg2](./sln/msg2))         
    *   [msg3.txt](./msg3.txt) (solution [sln/msg3.txt](./sln/msg3.txt)) 

*   Files that your program will be capable of decrypting.  You'll just have to see for yourself what they contain!
    *   [secret0.txt](./secret0.txt)
    *   [secret1.txt](./secret1.txt)
*   The [`test/`](./test/) directory contains files that test your decrypter on specific character sets:
    *   lower case characters
    *   upper case characters
    *   all special characters
    *   individual special character groups
    *   all valid DuckieCrypt characters
    *   invalid characters
*   Plain text files for use with [`../demo/duckieEncrypter.py`](../demo/duckieEncrypter.py)
    *   [encryptMe0.txt](./encryptMe0.txt)
    *   [encryptMe1.txt](./encryptMe1.txt)
