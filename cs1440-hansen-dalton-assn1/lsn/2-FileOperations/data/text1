Not every file needs a file extension!

There is nothing stopping me from making this text file appear as if it's a
markdown file by adding `.md`, or making it appear as a simple text file by
adding `.txt`, or making it *appear* as if it's a picture by adding `.png`.

File extensions are a convention used to easily identify the contents of a file.

There is nothing on your computer directly enforcing that file extensions should
match their contents.

However, file extensions *do* matter, especially when the file is being used by
another program on your computer that is not a simple text editor.

Dependent on the software and your operating system, renaming a picture from
`.png` to `.txt` may make it so your computer can not properly view the images
contents.
