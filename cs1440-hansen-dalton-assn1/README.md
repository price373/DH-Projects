## Overview

Your internship at DuckieCorp will be challenging, but we hope you find your management team and the tools we teach you about to be as helpful as possible during your time with us.

This first project is designed to refresh your Python and problem solving skills.  For this project you will create an automated decrypter tool for DuckieCrypt.  DuckieCrypt is created from a proprietary encryption algorithm used internally for sensitive messages here within DuckieCorp. With any luck, we will eventually find some customers to sell it to.  Although one *can* decrypt DuckieCrypt messages by hand, an automated tool will significantly cut down the time needed to decrypt while increasing accuracy.

To start off your first project, DuckieCorp has given you a small set of exercises located in the [`lsn/`](lsn/) directory of the starter code repository.  These exercises test the Python skills used to create the DuckieDecrypter, slowly building you up so you can create the decrypter with ease. More on these exercises below. **Completion of these exercises is required for all iterns.**

After completing the exercises you will be ready to tackle the DuckieDecrypter. The instructions and specifications for crafting the DuckieDecrypter will be found inside the file at [`instructions/`](instructions/) directory. It is advised to familiarize yourself with the instructions for the DuckieDecrypter before starting the lessons so you can make the most connection between the material found in [`lsn/`](lsn/) and the construction of our decrypter.
