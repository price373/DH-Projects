Review of the C++ Team's Designs
------------------------------------------------------------
The C++ team's Design was pretty well done and documented. The UML Class diagram clearly states what classes are used, what classes contain another, and also the interactions and methods contained within each class, along with datatypes and variables.
The Software Development Plan, on the other hand, describes every part of the program in a clear and concise fashion, leading to an ease of modification and planning for other developers involved within the creation of the Bingo Program.

The detail that their Diagram went to let me see how the program was to work. I can see all the functions, methods, and classes within along with desired input and given outputs, while letting you see what is public or private. Additionally it shows a how each class and module interacts within the confines of the program, so the user interface CONTAINS the deck object that contains the card objects rather than storing the data in a separate area. 

The Class diagram helped immensely with my understanding of the variables and functionalities expected for each class. Like how the User Interface has the save deck and create deck functions. Although it interacts with the deck, rather than just interacting it is creating the things to ensure the full use. I thought that the user interaction was going to be handled by the User Interface, but found out while looking at the diagram that all the prompt and options for input are taken straight from the menu class in the file.

While the class diagram was useful, it severely lacked in the details of how it works. So while able to see what was needed to work the Class Diagram needs the supplementary information from the SDP to properly understand what is being detailed in this program. I didn't realize until I thoroughly read the SDP but the bingo cards had a max number variable that could be changed, so that no bingo cards will have a value that exceeds it. I also was able to see that the deck class is just what it says it is. It is a Deck that contains the cards, with a little nuance in how it creates the cards that it stores within itself.
